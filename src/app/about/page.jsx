          ProperHomes was founded in October 2024 with a mission to disrupt the
          real estate market in India. In a market saturated with
          advertisements, scams, and unverified listings, we recognized the
          urgent need for a reliable and user-centric platform. Our goal is to
          provide quality verified property listings, streamline real estate
          transactions, and ensure the safety and satisfaction of our users.
